 so lexical analysis is the first page of compilation process and this lexical analyser is sometimes also called as Kana now why scanner because this is the only face with gets to interact with the source program should be source program here is nothing but our high level language program se for example if there is a c compiler then the source program would be a high level language program which is written in C language and as well as it get it gets into the compiler it first goes to the lexical analyser also called as camp with scans the input from the C program for hence it is also called as I can see why it is called as a lexical analyser so it is the interface of the compiler to the outside world this is the only phase which receives the input from the C program to get the source program which is safe for example in C or any high level language the lexical analyser stars is to give a stream of tokens Nabi tokens are basically representation of logically cohesive sequence of characters to be sequence of tokens are also referred to as Lexi hence the name of the save is lexical analysis the water token can we for any specific language it depends on the line image which is considered show some common examples of tokens are listed here so keywords from the language can be the example of tokens operators identifier symbols constant from string with you take as input all these are type of tokens so basically these are the vocabulary of any language write so whenever you try to learn a new language were taught what are the keywords in this language for tour operators you can use what all are the rules to generate the name for a identify identify everything but a variable or a variable name with you give symbols various symbols which are allowed and there could be some constant numbers in the program there could be some strings se printer statements have string inside have some text inside "that is referred to as strings so what does a lexical analyser do it scans the input source program identify the valid words from the language what could be there is valid words this can be any one of these which are listed it also removes the extra white spaces while writing the program is then you might give some extra blank spaces you also provide certain comments so all these things are not meaningful to the program right so all these are removed and only the important words which are Koi called as tokens for leg zines which belong to that language would be extracted now generally a lexical analyser is implemented as a finite automata so just to remind you what a finite automata is you start from a starting state this se start state is is 0 and then if you get some input se you go and proceed to some others date and this goes on until you reach se final state that is to accept any token or to do tokenization we need to implement a finite automata so lexical analyser in just some of what a lexical analyser Does It Breaks up the source program into tokens what are tokens tokens could be keyword operator identify anything and how is it done flood know whether the incoming now everything is scanned a character by character se if I have in the program void so it will first can we then over then I then the and then comes up space after it Encounters BOI ID and then it gets to know of space is there it knows ok before space the world was wide and it then checks whether wide can be part of anything any token which is specified in the language yes why I recognise wide is a reserved word or maybe it can be simply called as a Keyword because it has a reserved meaning in a language to avoid is used in the sea so I'll show you an example here
