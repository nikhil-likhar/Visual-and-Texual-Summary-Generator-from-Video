 welcome to the session on what is influenced without any time let's skip on the agenda to see what all to be covering in a session with this session by first discussing what is database and then you want to discuss .  Oppo using the electronic service what should I do that to move on to discuss why company's biggest mall using it for any other cloud provider to discuss what is it and why is it important to look at some basic services that it has to offer and then move on to discuss the Global infrastructure that will and pricing options provided by knowledge and discuss the first topic of today's session which is what is .  Amazon Web Services .  blood leader in cloud computing it was launched way back in 2006 when no company has the cloud computing business model and now today 70% of the whole Cloud Computing market is residing on big companies who are .  vestige look at the companies from the prominent companies were using the age of Lewis infrastructure companies like .  electric Netflix and Amazon which are using a database infrastructure for their operations on Amazon are completely dependent upon the if these two companies which are so big and the whole world is using your application is going to share the same infrastructure as these are so you can imagine that you are application is in safe you can be assured that having said that you want to discuss but why do companies .  advantage of having the cloud computing Technology with you shed light on that and for that that take in exam say you .  starting a business to business is Instagram you think of launching Instagram application and you have the application release now you are to make it available to the world the first thing to do is to have to invest some money by some servers .  applications of very small user base and you say ok so in one month so I can expect that so and so users will be there but your plan doesn't go according to your will and What happens in .  become so well that there are millions of users were trying to access the service that you had an overloaded with the kind of traffic which is coming in and you get very anxious as to what I do you invest more money by some more servers and now the situation seems to be a little but also use our machine we should not forget about it they are bound to break them so what would happen to us .  the application is not working how to fix this again you have to hire maintenance team which is now going to manage two servers view that is any kind of server upgrade which is required any kind of software up as it has to be put in a server goes on replacing it with a new server on that is now going to be managed by the maintenance of the kind of attention that was required for you to give to your application it could not get directions because the house we intention was to the infrastructure side of which is understandable so these are the problems before cloud computing and one fine day e w s came up and said .  world best thing about it is that you are you don't buy this service for me you can just read them from using for the time you wanted to and give them anytime you want to give it to me if I was you just pay for the fibres time the used at the same time you don't have to worry about the maintenance right I will do the maintenance of my server and with this was like in the God came in and let me help you like that so this was a very good deal for you because now you're not spending money on buying service not spending money on the maintenance team everything is being managed by the cheap price of paralysis very awesome so moving forward issued by .  companies adopting a dog or any other cloud platform what is that you want to discuss the services example .  next example of a website skeleton architecture for very normal website that is their function the use of or she goes on to a website on the Internet and its types in evidence that it was then goes to a DNS server DNS server basically get start converted into an IP address that IP address point solute in that Load Balancer in turn is distributed the traffic Among many of the servers and you end up on any one of these and this is a gain connected to a relational database and insulation layer 20 is basically have all the information visit their website and also would these entities that is a database and network so that they can communicate with each other which are there in a cloud computing right now take the same problem as before that was certainly a whole lot of user group company and its servers become overburden how do you take care of that you have to take care of anything Cloud Computing model is it take care of itself it so it automatically sensors that you know the server getting over it adds server automatically and now a situation becomes normal this is how the cloud computing Boltzmann to help you are having seen this architecture look at how these services are the components will look when he took it from the nearest perspective services .  this was the web servers that we discussed our servers the relational databases RDS the network in which these components will be enclosed in IAS BPSC answer is again and property which increases the number of servers and lois them according to traffic is auto scaling the basic services offered by us and these are all the services that we were to discuss moving forward nonsense .  that is a process to offer provides .  it has a global presence rights and is orange flowers are the region said they replace each region has multiple zones and zones and nothing but shows that the centres with a lot of service problem when you choose America to the US the problem will be ending somewhere around here to which religion is this and other region is this one's own would be one circle and this is how it functions write in alld e 3 Geographic regions around the world and in 50 availability zones F50 shoes sale centres Around The World are at your disposal in need of global infrastructure is a question the bi take the same example for the website servers and this was a now distributed among different places for the world does it give you it helps in a disaster recovery situation you all again have these two servers to so your traffic from so this was on because a power outage or any natural calamity your application is still up because it has been hosted in different regions advantages that it serves the purpose of users from different countries for example in this country in which website you can access this rather than having a server that one Central location Which will only have considered a response time if a customer is out the country but also a very bad measure take when we have to consider about disaster recovery this is the reason that has a global presence of a global infrastructure so it is there so that your customers can have the lowest latency possible and also you can implement the best disaster recovery measures having said that let's not talk about a w s price in there is now a days price .  amazing place to discuss so we have a per hour blink and a system so and pricing is also region-specific in the sense that each region has different pricing for defensive don't deserve much but still they are different from each other for each region can choose the region according to a preferred also this thing called reserved instances AWS reserved instance you save up to 90% Cost Analysis of this is basically means you rent the server for particular term 1 year term 3 auto in many do that when you compare it with on-demand tries to save up to 90% which is awesome and also there is an option for spot pricing is well where in you get incredibly low prices by bidding on servers for particular price on server for sale for $2 a server is available you can it right you used as they were until the price goes up this server is taken automatically find it could be helpful for work is wearing the work is not that was it but you want to get it done in the minimum cost possible so it will help you with that and that guys we come to an .  overview thank you guys for during this session I hope you guys learn
