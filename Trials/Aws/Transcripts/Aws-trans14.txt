 next example of a website skeleton architecture for very normal website that is their function the use of or she goes on to a website on the Internet and its types in evidence that it was then goes to a DNS server DNS server basically get start converted into an IP address that IP address point solute in that Load Balancer in turn is distributed the traffic Among many of the servers and you end up on any one of these and this is a gain connected to a relational database and insulation layer 20 is basically have all the information visit their website and also would these entities that is a database and network so that they can communicate with each other which are there in a cloud computing right now take the same problem as before that was certainly a whole lot of user group company and its servers become overburden how do you take care of that you have to take care of anything Cloud Computing model is it take care of itself it so it automatically sensors that you know the server getting over it adds server automatically and now a situation becomes normal this is how the cloud computing Boltzmann to help you are having seen this architecture look at how these services are the components will look when he took it from the nearest perspective services
