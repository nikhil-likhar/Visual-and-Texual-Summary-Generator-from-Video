 .  hi everyone my name is Ishan in a welcome you are .  in this session we will be talking about Agile project management and several everything related to it before we Begin that have a look at all the topics we will be coming .  first you see the basics of agile project management then we will check the relevance and principles of agile project management used in C necessary steps to implement Agile methodology along with that we shall also see different frameworks involved in the process and finally we shall see some companies that use Agile project management so without any further ADO let's get started with what is Agile project management Agile project .  the name suggests is a flexible approach to building a project in Agile project management the project is broken down into several stages of sprint Agile does not work .  delivering the final product at the end of the project works and delivering sections of a project on mini project the process of project management in the case of a joint .  so there won't be any Central control of project manager as it was there in the traditional way of working before We moved for let's have a look at the Agile development cycle .  consists of several small cycles as time at the end of each stage we get a mini project that the product backlog that explains new features changes in the existing features and several other improvements in the project then we have a sprint .  list of task that are to be completed during each sprint .  planning designing execution testing and deployment stages and at the end of each sprint a mini project is delivered with every sprint new features are added to the product which plays a significant role in the overall protect growth after all the spring and early validation in the development of the final deliverable has a few chances of failure left now have a look at some reasons why industries and started moving .  the first reason is high product quality when we talk about .  we refer to the builder of the product as per stakeholders demand testing is performed at short intervals of time whenever needed to ensure high quality of the product then .  customer satisfaction whatever is done in the project is done by the customer that delivery is don't take longer duration as they used to take in the case of traditional ways the changes may be provided by the customer in the execution phase of the project third region is .  since the project is divided into space through the risk effects once print it doesn't mean whole of the project will be at risk the process of risk analysis continues to take place with all the other process another significant reason for Agile project .  better and faster return on investment the project is not developed in civils Prince and each sprint has its own version therefore the project becomes market ready after few seconds only since the project can now be released with ease and shorter duration this helps your organisation to stay ahead in competition with respect to other organisations which are still not moved to Agile methodology now we shall check the .  project management there are 10 principles for successful Agile project .  the first principle is it satisfaction of the customer by delivering the product .  least number of errors the next principal refers to decreasing the amount of time between the face of planning and delivery method principle states that the team of managers and Developers work together and increase the productivity of the work when X principle states that the change is requested by stakeholders can be taken into consideration and work upon during the development phase as well V principal pay attention to the factor of coordination among team members then the 6 principal refers to the process of monitoring and tracking the progress of the project at the end of each sprint and making amendment wherever needed moving on the next principle states that there must be a feeling of trust and support towards the team to complete the project objective the next principal emphasizes on face-to-face conversations with the development team the face-to-face conversation helps in both solving problems and easy knowledge sharing than the knife principal emphasizes on finding solution and maximizing the amount of work done with sim implicitly this ensures timely completion of task by all the team members the last possible state that scrum tools like monday.com for Zoho sprints must be used to simplify the complicated code which for their help in saving time we should now see the steps in Agile project management the goal of agile .  to produce shorter development life cycle and more frequent product releases than traditional waterfall project management so we will now check six steps in Agile project methodology the first step in the process is Project Planning Project Planning includes .  study development of scope Breaking the project into executable tasks as prints and then estimating the amount of time needed to complete the spring the second step every step of road map creation road map is a plan of action that shows how production evolved over time a list of all the features that the final product should have is created in the steps to achieve the teachers are taken the next important step is release planning since we are doing the project keeping in mind the Agile project methodology the project will complete in springs that means there will be the release of teachers at the end of each cycle and Unlike the traditional Waterfall model the development cycle will be small .  in Agile project management is sprint planning the spring Summer Heat keeping in mind what all is to be accomplished in that particular step at the beginning of each sprint the goal of the sprint is decided and steps to achieve that goal are taken .  process emphasizes on daily meetings there are short meeting everyday to discuss if the team was able to finish the task for each sprint and check if there are any amendments that are required each team member talks about what they achieved in the last print and what are they going to work on in the next print the last step is .  interview and retrospective there are two meeting after each print first meeting is not the sprint review this meeting is with the stakeholders to show them the finished product this helps both sides to build a relationship and discuss if there are any issues in the end product the second meeting is for having a sprint retrospective this meeting involved the stakeholders to discuss what went well and what went wrong during the sprint sprint retrospective takes place after the sprint review and before the next trip planning .  the steps needed for Agile project methodology we must understand some Agile project management frameworks there are several frameworks available today here .  discussing some of the most popular Framework the first Framework people desk .  kanban Framework Framework is a well-known Framework for implementing Agile Software Development in the case of kanban Framework work items are represented on the kanban board which helps all the team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time kanban board not only helps in visualising the work but also optimising the workflow among the team the next Framework we will discuss today is the scrum Framework scrum Framework is a popular Framework for managing Complex knowledge to work like in the field of research and advanced technology is a simple Framework that helps team work together and learn through the experiences gained while working on a problem III Framework we will see today is the hybrid Framework the hybrid Framework is a combination of agile methodology and non Agile methodology in the case of a hybrid Framework planning is done using the traditional way of project management while the execution and delivery is done using the Agile methodology since the hybrid is a combination of the two it handles the requirement changes and delivers the product in different stages the fourth and the last member we will see .  Selenium Framework works on the principle of providing maximum customer value and creating zero waste it focuses on optimising the flow of product all through the value stream that helps in eliminating waste all through the process and create processes that requires less human effort this also simplifies the process of information management and makes it more accurate finally let's have a look at .  data opted for Agile project management today around 22 .  patients worldwide have all the teams working on the principle of agile project methodology let's have a look at some of the most prominent companies in the world that use Agile project management in the list we have IBM Cisco .  Microsoft Phillips and sons and with this we have come to the end .
