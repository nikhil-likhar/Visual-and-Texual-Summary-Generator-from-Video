 Google talk about rest vs soap dispensing time understanding both of them and we'll discuss which one is better or do we really need to compare rest and soap in this video we going to discuss what is the service will spend some time talking about some Practical uses of Web Services will take a look at different type of services and then will spend time on soap will spend some time understanding how rest work and finally be origin of soap and rest understand what is a web service a web service is nothing but a piece of software that makes itself available over the internet it is nothing but calls or you can say a standard for exchanging data between different applications or system the exchange of this data is preferably in a standard format like JSON or XML the importance that of a web service is to provide a service not necessarily and user interface for humans to consume so you can say that the web services are meant mostly for other application or systems or in simple language a website humans to communicate and collaborate using a web browser or maybe a mobile app where as a web service allow system communicate and collaborate some practical of activities of you are using amazon.com on amazon.co.uk to browse the list of different products you are retrieving information about all the TV is of a specific category you would be using a web service you would be doing it either through a browser or may be using a mobile app when you are interacting with the Amazon for example but internally this particular retrieval of information is done using a web service you can also submit an order to Amazon by going to either their browser or maybe you can do it from a mobile app for you have different clients like a browser or their mobile app to submit some information to provide some information to your service provider you can also update information for example can I update your account information like phone number you can change your address or you can play the inorder to whenever you are updating something you are also using other service in the background and if you're interested in providing that service tyrone Jackson which is to allow these similar operations on your own website you have a website that provide some information to two schools or maybe to colleges maybe you have created some kind of an alumni network you can also create the web services to to allow other people to interact with your website either through a browser on my way using some kind of a mobile app a good example is a mobile app that all of you are using for Amazon for Facebook and you are different apps from Google when you when you're using Google Maps you are actually using a web service for interacting with Google servers and Vivo mobile apps for most cases using some kind of an ap I know we have different type of web server family we have soap based web services and then we have rest based Web Services so that is not understand both of them starting with so nothing but a simple object access protocol and as the name suggest it is nothing but a protocol you can work on almost any internet protocol when you're working with soap you can use the http you can use FTP you can use MTU for example so you can say that soap works on variety of products the thing that you need to be causes of start Roop can only support XML file type and the soup actually supports FL and you can also use ws-security that is enterprise level security and the way so works is by sending an envelope and that envelope contains information of what you want to do with your web service so what you do you need to send gift envelope to the service provider and in your sending this whole bunch of this big and love it requires more bandwidth and you can see here on the that typical soap envelope will have some header it will also have some body with the wsdl file which is nothing but a web service definition language so to understand how soapworks you can that you have a consumer like a service consumer who is trying to get some information from a service provider so what you will do you would send your soap request which is using this XML file where you will love contact an endpoint URL for example to get details of a tv you will probably send this the model number in this particular XML definition you get a response which is nothing but again now and XML file with the details of the model that you requested so when you are sending this request you are including this information of the model and what you want to do with it in your soap envelope to this is how you are typical soap request will work now let us now understand how in West which is known as a presentation of state transfer was nothing but a form of some architecture it is it is it is not architecture is not with your product quality compared with soap and rest Mushkil works on http it is very important to know that you can't really use some of the protocols it was mostly in most cases over http and which uses http for all for crud operations or for all four http methods known as create for posting the information which is nothing but get then have update and delete to you have create read update and delete for the are the 4 crud operations and these are nothing but you http method and if you compare your rest with your scope you're not really sending the whole and block you are actually sending a postcard and will understand how breast works in a minute but just to come visit to a comparison West requires a lot less bandwidth and rest permits not only XML you can also use some other file types like this and all you can also use a text file for example so you are not really really limited to XML files folders now understand how the how the rest will work and if we do a comparison from the previous example of the Opera we have a service provider and service consumer will also try to understand how wrestler behave and and one more thing which I forgot to mention is the concept of the business logic for example if you remember in the soap based request your sending the whole and club and the business logic is not very clear because that is defined in the envelope itself but when you look at the rest base request you are trying to access the URL and that you are is the resource you are and you connect TP the business logic by looking at the you are itself so if you compare rest will work with soap we have again a consumer and we have a provider so when you send a request you are using a resource you are I and since you doing some retrieval of a TV model if we try to do the same thing using rest you can see here that we have their say you are I that a casual talks about what you are trying to do using get method when you say get and when you type in your you are I in your code you are trying to specify the resource directly light flash electronics Flash TV then you are using / model number and finally you have your actual model number so when you try to use this resource you are I you get a response that which is nothing but a simple XML response similar to your so but if you are looking at the specific request you are actively looking at the business logic itself so it is actually a lightweight a lightweight request for retrieving a simple TV model and leads to find the comparison of soap vs rest talking about both of them were both language Independent and the rest if using http most of the time you can say that they react API status codes for the status code of the request is something which is user defined in soap unit define your own own own status code whether the request was successful or whether the request was not successful but in case of breast since it is using http you have your standard http status codes like no 107 207 so on so there is something that you need to be aware of when it comes to security because not only it uses the enterprise level security its its own security but when it comes to banking applications they try to hide the business logic itself and they can also hide the whole and block where as invest it is also secured you can also use you can also use this request they arrest request and sent over on the NFL you can use of course your https but as compared to so that is slightly less secure and this could be a concern for very very critical applications that are used in banking because I want to fight almost everything they don't want to leave leave any loopholes and when it comes to overhead since in we are sending the whole and love it is definitely a slightly more happier if you compare it with the rest in most cases you need to send the whole XML file and whenever you are doing some operation you are sending lot of data across and that is why it uses more bandwidth where at rest is is very lightweight and when it comes to strict standards we have very strict standards in soapui need to define the contract in the wsdl file where they know rest it is nothing but based on http and the standards are not that spread through thank you very much for watching this video I hope
