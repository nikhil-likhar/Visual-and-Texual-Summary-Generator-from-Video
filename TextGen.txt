this is the input program given to the lexical analyser I have written a small C program with print the numbers from 1 to 10 and you give it to the lexical analyser and just want to see what will be the output of it so the output would be every single token is identified and now something has to be done with these tokens will see what has to be done so in this for the video for a moment and try to count how many tokens will be there what these tokens will be so wide is one main is one opening (closing) {in account; all these are different tokens less than equal to 10 10 is a separate token; is a separate tokens of all these tokens would be identified this is the work of a lexical analyser using all these tokens it stores this in a symbol table

welcome to new lecture on phases of compiler the objective of the Lecturer student




	Phases-extract2.wav

phases of compilation and then we try to relate them to language construct the language constructs you might have already studied in theory of computation so this brief overview of




	Phases-extract3.wav

is the compiler was already discussed in the previous lecture in this lecture will go through each of the phases in compiler and try to explore its details
