lexical analysis is the first page of the compilation process. the source program is a high level language program which is written in C language and as well as it gets it into the compiler it is also called as camp with scans the input from the C program for this is not the only phase which receives input to the c program to get the sources program that is safe for example in the language's' so lexical analysis is the first page of compilation process and this lexical analyser is sometimes also called as Kana now why scanner because this is the only face with gets to interact with the source program should be source program here is nothing but our high level language program se for example if there is a c compiler then the source program would be a high level language program which is written in C language and as well as it get it gets into the compiler it first goes to the lexical analyser also called as camp with scans the input from the C program for hence it is also called as I can see why it is called as a lexical analyser so it is the interface of the compiler to the outside world this is the only phase which receives the input from the C program to get the source program which is safe for example in C or any high level language the lexical analyser stars is to give a stream of tokens Nabi tokens are basically representation of logically cohesive sequence of characters to be sequence of tokens are also referred to as Lexi hence the name of the save is lexical analysis the water tokenso whenever you try to learn a new language were taught what are the keywords in this language for tour operators you can use what all are the rules to generate the name for a identify identify everything but a variable or a variable name with you give symbols various symbols which are allowed and there could be some constant numbers in the program there could be some strings se printer statements have string inside have some text inside "that is referred to as strings so what does a lexical analyser do it scans the input source program identify the valid words from the language what could be there is valid words this can be any one of these which are listed it also removes the extra white spaces while writing the program is then you might give some extra blank spaces you also provide certain comments so all these things are not meaningful to the program
